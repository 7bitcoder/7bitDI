Core Classes
========================================

The library relies on two core classes:

* ServiceCollection_: class is responsible for registering services and building service provider
* ServiceProvider_: class is responsible for delivering real services and managing its lifetime

.. _ServiceCollection: ../reference/di/servicecollection.html
.. _IServiceProvider: ../reference/di/serviceprovider.html

.. literalinclude:: ../../Examples/Guides/CoreClasses.cpp
